## Connecting to Archipelago Game

With the game open:
- Open up the ImGUI window (default keybind is `insert`)
- Type in server address, slot, and password (if applicable) into the "Connection" window, then press "Connect"
- If the tracker window is updated to show your current progress you should be connected

Currently there is not any ingame UI to relay server information, so it's recommended to have a text client open for this reason.
