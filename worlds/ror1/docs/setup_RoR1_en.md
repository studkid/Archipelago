# Risk of Rain (2013) Setup Guide

## Installing Archipelago Mod

**Linux Users**: The modloader only works with the windows version of the game.  To fix this, right click on **Risk of Rain (2013)** from your library and select `Properties > Compatibility > Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool`.  Next time you run the game it will download the windows version of the game.

Download the Risk of Rain Modloader from Rainfusion:

Download the `RoR_AP_Mod` zip from the GitHub page:

[Risk of Rain AP Mod Releases Page](https://github.com/studkid/RoR_Archipelago/releases/)

Run `RoRML Launcher.exe` and run through the installer prompt.  It will ask you where your Risk of Rain (2013) install is located.  To find this, On Steam find **Risk of Rain (2013)** in your library.  Right click, select `Manage > Browse local files`.  

Once installation is complete, navigate back to your Risk of Rain (2013) install.  There should be a new folder labeled `ModLoader`.  Open this folder and extract the contents of the `RoR_AP_Mod.zip` into this folder, merge and replace any files if necessary.  

Run `RoRML Launcher` once again and you should now have a new window displaying currently installed mods.  If you followed the prior step, you should see `Archipelago Randomizer` listed in the `Disabled` box.  Click on it and click the "Enable" button.

## Connecting to Archipelago Game

In RoRML Launcher, click on the `Archipelago Ranomizer` mod.  Once selected, on the right side of the screen will be the mod options.  Input your server address, slot name, and password into the corresponding boxes.

Item pickup step, deathlink, and ringlink settings can also be updated here to your preferance.  Any changes will require you to reboot the game however.
